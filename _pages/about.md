Hi, my name is Noah Heintz and I am currently based in the Denver metropolitan area. I am a graduate of the University of Florida with a Bachelor's in Nuclear Engineering, Navy Submarine Veteran and Drilling Reservist, and currently in my first year at University of Colorado-Boulder as a Master's Student in Applied Mathematics--specializing in Statistics and Data Science. I am pursuing my passion of data-driven decision making and predictive analytics, with a strong focus in employing next-generational technology in the Business and Engineering sectors.

I have experience in Program Management and Leadership through my time as a Naval Officer, and I am actively gaining experience in Python, SQL, Tableau, and R through my graduate studies. I chose Applied Mathematics to prioritize understanding statistical theory and modeling algorithms at a high level, in order to provide sound recommendations to leaders and business teams on how to best utilize data to deliver maximum value.

Outside of professional endeavors, I am an avid skier, traveller, reader, and foodie. I would describe myself as open-minded, easy to get along with, meticulous with time management, and effective at establishing systems to achieve my goals, whether in my personal or professional life. I love meeting motivated people and building rapport through a challenging and rewarding environment.
