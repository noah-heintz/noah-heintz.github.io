### Education

* University of Colorado Boulder - MS in Applied Mathematics (Spring 2027)
  * Specialization in Statistics and Data Science

* University of Florida - BS in Nuclear Engineering (Spring 2018)

### Projects

#### Exploratory Data Analysis of Effects of Social Media Use

* I performed EDA on a data set measuring social media addictiveness, mental health, and average usage hours across a variety of demographics to include age, education, and gender. Statistical methods used include bootstrapping, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. Visualizations and analysis were performed in Python using matplotlib.

* The analysis showed statistical significance that high school students were more susceptible to the negative effects of social media than undergraduate and graduate students. Visualizations indicated that the spread of harmful effects is larger in women, though there were more outliers for poor mental health in men. The most harmful social media platforms proved to be Instagram and Tik-Tok, likely due to their algorithmic structure and endless scrolling environment. 

#### Principal Component Analysis of Socioeconomic and Incarceration Trends

* An unsupervised machine learning analysis was conducted using linear algebraic methods of singular value decomposition to search for trends in two datasets, joined together using SQL within Postgres. In order to perform dimensionality reduction for ease of analysis, principal component analysis was chosen as the methodology of interest, utilizing Python with the libraries Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and scikit imported. 

* After analysis, three categories were identified as containing the most variance in the dataset (top three principal components), to include economic well-being, globalization, and investment in health care infrastructure. These insights are useful for leaders to consider in order to shape decision-making on economic investments and minimize spending on incarceration. The resulting clusters developed from this project could be further analyzed in additional machine learning techniques.

### Work Experience

#### Submarine Warfare Officer - USN
* My previous roles included serving in the US Navy's Nuclear Propulsion program, where I was in charge of safe navigation and daily operation of the submarine, as well as supervising the nuclear power plant. I developed skills in data-driven decision making in high stakes environments, mitigating and communicating risk with leadership daily to accomplish the mission.

* I also acted as a Program Manager for both the Reactor Control Division and Tactical Systems divisions during my time, leading groups of highly motivated individuals in day-to-day operations in adhering to rigorous operational standards. I led other endeavors to include planning a torpedo exercise and administrating acoustic data collection, briefing the teams on milestones and deliverables to ensure these were executed with precision and success. 

* My most recent job was as a technical writer for the tomahawk missile and hypersonic missile programs, working with defense contractors to promulgate new technological developments and proactively integrate these capabilities into the front lines. I also spent time as a instructor and liasion to air wing squadrons, explaining how to integrate these capabilities with the mission of the pilots in order to best synchronize effects and maximize safety.
